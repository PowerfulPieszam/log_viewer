## ‚ö†Ô∏è Possible installation issues

On some systems for example Python 3.11/3.12 on Linux or Python installed from the Microsoft store you may encounter the following error when installing dependencies:
error: externally-managed-environment

This means that you cannot install packages globally.  
The recommended solution is to create and use a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
# Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate
# Linux
source .venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Alternatively, you can force the installation globally I do not recommend that:
```bash
pip install customtkinter --break-system-packages
```

If that doesn't help, ask AI, after all, it's the 21st century.
